  About Myself
</h2>

<p>
Hello There! I am a Professional Python Developer specialized in Data Science and Machine Learning. Apart from my work I also teach time to time because i like teaching so i can help new people code. I taught Python Programming, Data Science and Machine Learning courses created by myself with number of interesting projects. I possess more than 5 years of experience in teaching these topics and have the content ready to be taught for Python Programming, Data Science and Machine Learning. <br>
I have been teaching on many platforms, you can check the reviews on fiverr:<br>
<h3>Fiverr : https://www.fiverr.com/uxama_/be-your-python-tutor</h3>


I charge 20$ per hour for python tutoring.<br>
To start your journey, email me at pythontutoronline@gmail.com and then we will get started on Zoom one-to-one online sessions. I will also share other details like  Skype, Whatsapp so you can quickly reach out to me. Avoid messaging on fiverr if you have found me through this post as i won't be able to share Skype, Whatsapp, Zoom link on fiverr.<br>

I love to help people in achieving their goals and my students always find programming very interesting when I teach them, and now they are Confident and Professionals in their field.<br>
Moreover, I provide my students with all resources and tasks time to time to increase their ability of problem solving. In my tutoring sessions my goal is not just to fimiliarize you with the syntax, I focus more on developing problem solving skills by challenging your critical thinking abilities and explaining how programming actually works behind the scenes (code dry run practice). First, I teach my students the basics of programming, then we do projects together which really helps them to think like a programmer. So, you will be coding yourself in no time.<br>
Feel free to reach out to me on my email (pythontutoronline@gmail.com) so that we can talk about your goals and how my tutoring can help you in achieving your programming goals. I would love to hear from you ðŸ˜Š
